This project is my submission for the Assignment 5 of my Data Mining course.
All of the code was written by John Phillips (me).

To run the program, ensure that you have the two following files:
    naiveBayes.py
    naiveBayesFunctions.py

To compile and run this program, type the following command into the command
line:

    python naiveBayes.py

Follow the prompts given from the program to submit a labelled data set in order
to execute the algorithm.

The output will be placed in an external file called Result.txt.


- What is this program for?
  This program is a classifier for labelled data.


- Compile the program (in Unix environment) and Run the program
  python naiveBayes.py


- Check Result
	$cat Result.txt

- Overview the program code:

  The program consists of two files:
    naiveBayes.py
    naiveBayesFunctions.py
  naiveBayes.py is the main file which controls the flow of individual functions,
  which are contained in naiveBayesFunctions.py.

- The following is the program structure:

	main()
      ---->	read input for training data file
			----> check file exist
      ---->	read input for training data file
      ----> check file exist
			----> Make sure both files have the same attributes
      ----> read input for target attribute

      ----> identifyAttributes() to find all possible values for all attributes in training data
      ----> train() to train the classifier with the training data

			----> generateResults() to run through the test data and label each tuple based on the
            occurrences from the training data classifier model

	    ---->	output the result into "Result.txt" file
